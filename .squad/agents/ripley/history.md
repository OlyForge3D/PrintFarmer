# Ripley History

## Core Context

Ripley is the frontend architect and API integration specialist. Key retained context:
- Owns printer-card UX, BedClearBanner behavior, and frontend cache/signal updates for auto-dispatch state.
- Prefers centralizing transport compatibility in `src/Web/ReactApp/src/services/` wrappers so product language can stay clean in hooks/components.
- Uses focused React integration tests to protect compact-card, banner, and SignalR merge seams where stale partial payloads can hide operator actions.
- Consolidates repeated status affordances into a single predictable surface when duplicate UI adds cognitive load.

Early detailed entries were summarized on 2026-03-25 for maintainability. See decisions and orchestration logs for source detail.

### Summarized history
- 2026-03-25: Finalized icon-only failure-detection badge behavior, removed redundant camera overlays, and documented the header-badge-as-single-source pattern.
- 2026-03-25: Landed PendingReady compact-card fallback + live merge protections so failed bed-clear gates stay visible across stale bulk snapshots and partial SignalR payloads.
- 2026-03-25 to 2026-03-26: Completed frontend transport alignment toward canonical auto-dispatch naming while preserving a safe adapter strategy during transition.

## 2026-03-25: PendingReady compact-card fallback fix → LANDED

**Role:** Frontend Dev  
**Status:** ✅ Complete — commit e807133d landed on development

- Fixed `CompactPrinterCard` / `BedClearBanner` handling so a failed bed-clear gate with queued work still surfaces actionable Pending Ready UI even when the flattened bulk state is stale.
- Protected the live-update seam by preserving prior optional ready-gate detail when partial SignalR payloads omit it.
- Focused validation stayed green: 44/44 React tests in the targeted slice.
