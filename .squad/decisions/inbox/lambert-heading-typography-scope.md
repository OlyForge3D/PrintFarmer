## Decision

Limit the shared display-heading rule in `src/Web/ReactApp/src/index.css` to `h1` and `h2`.
Leave `h3` through `h6` on the default semantic typography path unless a surface opts into display styling explicitly.

## Rationale

The previous global rule forced Bebas and uppercase styling onto every heading level,
which made secondary headings overly loud on settings and unrelated pages.
Narrowing the rule solves the issue at the design-system layer instead of relying on
page-specific overrides.

## Impact

Pages such as Settings and API Keys can use `h3`-`h6` without inheriting display
heading treatment automatically.
Teams that want display styling below `h2` should add it intentionally at the component
or page level.
