# Squad Decisions

## Active Decisions

### Decision: Per-Printer Camera Rotation (Ripley)
**Date:** 2026-03-09  
**Status:** Implemented

## Context
Phrozen Arco printers (and potentially other models) display camera images upside-down. Users need a way to correct the camera orientation on a per-printer basis.

## Decisions
1. **Storage:** `cameraRotation: Int` property in `PrinterDetailViewModel` storing degrees (0, 90, 180, 270)
2. **Persistence:** UserDefaults with key pattern `"cameraRotation-{printerId.uuidString}"`
3. **UI:** Rotate button (`rotate.right` SF Symbol) in camera section header, next to refresh button
4. **Behavior:** Each tap rotates +90°, wrapping from 270→0
5. **Application:** `.rotationEffect(.degrees(Double(cameraRotation)))` applied to both `snapshotImage(from:)` and `asyncSnapshotImage(url:)`

## Rationale
- Per-printer storage allows different rotation for each printer model
- UserDefaults persistence survives app restarts
- UI placement next to refresh button keeps camera controls grouped
- Rotation applied to both data-based and URL-based images ensures consistent behavior
- 90° increments cover all common orientations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°)

## Files Modified
- `PrintFarmer/ViewModels/PrinterDetailViewModel.swift` — Added `cameraRotation` property, `rotateCameraView()` method, UserDefaults load in `init()` and `loadPrinter()`
- `PrintFarmer/Views/Printers/PrinterDetailView.swift` — Added rotate button in camera section header, applied `.rotationEffect()` to both image views

## Related Patterns
- **Per-printer settings pattern:** Key format `"{setting}-{printerId.uuidString}"` can be reused for other printer-specific preferences
- **Local preference override:** Similar to `lastSetSpoolInfo` pattern — preference changes take effect immediately without backend sync
- **Toolbar button grouping:** Related controls (rotate, refresh) placed adjacent in toolbar for discoverability

## Future Considerations
- If many per-printer settings accumulate, consider moving to a structured UserDefaults object or Core Data
- Could add a settings UI to reset all printer preferences if needed
- Backend could eventually store camera orientation metadata per printer model

### Decision: Spoolman Spool Model Naming & Pagination (Lambert)
**Date:** 2026-03-07  
**Status:** Implemented

## Context
Phase 1 filament/spool models needed to match backend DTOs precisely.

## Decisions

1. **Model names use `Spoolman` prefix** (`SpoolmanSpool`, `SpoolmanFilament`, `SpoolmanVendor`, `SpoolmanMaterial`) to match backend DTO names and avoid collision with future domain models (e.g., a simpler `Spool` view model).

2. **Pagination uses `limit`/`offset`** (not `page`/`pageSize`) — matches Spoolman's native API which the backend proxies. Return type is `SpoolmanPagedResult<T>` with `items` and `totalCount`.

3. **Added `patch()` to APIClient** — backend uses HTTP PATCH for spool and filament updates. This is a new HTTP method available to all services.

4. **`SetActiveSpoolRequest` returns `CommandResult`** (not `Printer`) — matches backend's `PrintersController.SetActiveSpoolAsync` which returns `CommandResult`.

5. **Added `changeFilament()` to PrinterService** — backend has `filament-change` (M600) in addition to `filament-load`/`filament-unload`. Included for completeness.

## Impact
- Ripley can build filament management UI against `SpoolServiceProtocol` and the extended `PrinterServiceProtocol`.
- ViewModels should use `SpoolmanPagedResult` for infinite scroll / pagination patterns.

---

### Filament UI Architecture (Ripley)
**Date:** 2026-03-07  
**Status:** Implemented

## Tab Structure Change
- Added **Inventory** tab (6th tab) to ContentView TabView using `cylinder.fill` SF Symbol
- Added `AppTab.inventory` case and `inventoryPath` NavigationPath to AppRouter
- Tab order: Dashboard → Printers → Jobs → Alerts → **Inventory** → Settings

## Filament Section in PrinterDetailView
- Filament section always renders between Camera and Actions sections
- Shows active spool info (color swatch, material, vendor, weight progress bar) or "No filament loaded" empty state
- "Load Filament" / "Change Filament" → presents SpoolPickerView as `.sheet`
- "Eject" → calls `printerService.setActiveSpool(nil)` + `printerService.unloadFilament()`
- `setActiveSpool(_:)` → calls `printerService.setActiveSpool(spoolId)` + `printerService.loadFilament()`

## SpoolService Dependency
- ViewModels use `SpoolServiceProtocol` (Lambert's protocol) via `ServiceContainer.spoolService`
- PrinterDetailViewModel uses `PrinterServiceProtocol` filament methods (setActiveSpool, loadFilament, unloadFilament) — NOT SpoolServiceProtocol
- SpoolPickerViewModel and SpoolInventoryViewModel use `SpoolServiceProtocol` for listing/creating/deleting spools

## Phase 2 NFC Hook
- SpoolPickerView and AddSpoolView are designed to accept NFC-scanned spool data (OpenSpool / OpenPrintTag formats)
- Future work: Add "Scan NFC" button that auto-populates spool fields from tag

**Impact:**
- **Lambert:** No changes needed — all services already built and working
- **Ash:** 3 new ViewModels need test coverage (SpoolPickerViewModel, SpoolInventoryViewModel, AddSpoolViewModel); MockSpoolService needed
- **Dallas:** AppRouter has new `inventory` case — any navigation routing logic should account for it

---

### Camera Snapshot Display Strategy (Ripley)
**Date:** 2025-07-18  
**Status:** Implemented

Two-tier loading strategy for camera snapshots in PrinterDetailView:
1. **Primary:** Load snapshot as `Data` via `PrinterServiceProtocol.getSnapshot(id:)` (authenticated, reliable)
2. **Fallback:** Display via `AsyncImage` from `Printer.cameraSnapshotUrl` (direct URL, no auth needed)
3. **Empty state:** "No camera available" placeholder when neither source exists

Service-based snapshot fetch handles auth tokens automatically; direct URL provides seamless fallback.

**Impact:**
- Lambert: No changes needed — existing `getSnapshot(id:)` contract unchanged
- Ash: `PrinterDetailViewModel` gains `isLoadingSnapshot: Bool` and `refreshSnapshot() async` — tests may need updating

---

### Push Notification Infrastructure (Lambert)
**Date:** 2026-07-17  
**Status:** Implemented (client-side); backend endpoint pending

#### Architecture
- **PushNotificationManager** is a `@MainActor @Observable` singleton owning APNs lifecycle
- **AppDelegate** adapter handles system callbacks and forwards to PushNotificationManager
- **NotificationService** extended with `registerDeviceToken` / `unregisterDeviceToken` methods

#### Backend Endpoint (Placeholder)
- NotificationsController.cs has an `EnablePushNotifications` preference flag but **no device token registration endpoint**
- Client uses placeholder paths: `POST /api/notifications/device-token` (register) and `DELETE /api/notifications/device-token/{token}` (unregister)
- **Action needed from Dallas:** Add device token registration endpoint to the backend. Suggested DTO: `{ token: string, platform: "ios" | "android" }`

#### Deep-Link Hook
- Tapped notifications post `Notification.Name.pushNotificationTapped` with the push payload's `userInfo`
- **Ripley** can observe this in `AppRouter` to navigate to the relevant printer/job detail screen

**Impact:**
- **Ripley:** SettingsView now has a push notification toggle. Deep-link notification available for navigation wiring
- **Dallas:** Backend needs a device token registration endpoint
- **Ash:** MockNotificationService updated with new protocol methods; existing tests unaffected

### Decision: XCUITest Target Setup (Ash)
**Date:** 2025-07-20  
**Status:** Needs Action (manual Xcode step required)

## Context
Created XCUITest scaffolding files in `PrintFarmerUITests/` directory to support cross-process UI testing.

## Decision
XCUITest **files** (PrintFarmerUITests.swift, LoginFlowUITests.swift, PrinterListUITests.swift) are ready, but the **XCUITest target** must be added to `PrintFarmer.xcodeproj` manually in Xcode because:
1. XCUITest targets require a specific target type (`com.apple.product-type.bundle.ui-testing`) with host app dependency
2. Build settings (TEST_HOST, TEST_TARGET_NAME) are complex and error-prone to hand-edit in pbxproj
3. Xcode's "Add Target → UI Testing Bundle" wizard handles all of this correctly

## Required Steps
1. Open `PrintFarmer.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. File → New → Target → "UI Testing Bundle"
3. Name: `PrintFarmerUITests`, Language: Swift, Target to Test: `PrintFarmer`
4. Delete the auto-generated test file (our files already exist in `PrintFarmerUITests/`)
5. Add the 3 existing `.swift` files to the new target
6. Verify the `--uitesting` launch argument is picked up by the app

## Impact
- **Ripley:** Should check for `--uitesting` in `ProcessInfo.processInfo.arguments` in `PFarmApp.swift` to enable mock mode
- **Lambert:** Mock server URL will be passed via launch argument `--mock-server-url=<url>`
- **All:** UI tests won't run until target is created in Xcode

## Mock Mode Contract
The UI tests pass `--uitesting` as a launch argument. The app should:
1. Check `ProcessInfo.processInfo.arguments.contains("--uitesting")`
2. If true, use stub/mock services instead of real network calls
3. Optionally accept `--mock-server-url=<url>` for Lambert's mock server

---

### Decision: MockAPIServer for XCUITest Support (Lambert)
**Date:** 2026-07-18  
**Status:** Implemented

## Context
XCUITests run the app in a separate process, so `MockURLProtocol` (in-process URLSession interception) cannot mock API responses for UI tests. We needed a cross-process solution.

## Decision
Built a real localhost HTTP server (`MockAPIServer`) using Apple's `NWListener` (Network framework) — zero external dependencies. The app checks a `PFARM_MOCK_SERVER_URL` environment variable at launch to redirect API calls to the mock server.

## Key Design Choices
1. **NWListener over URLProtocol** — works across process boundaries for XCUITest
2. **Random port** — avoids conflicts when tests run in parallel
3. **Wildcard routes** (`/api/printers/*`) — one route handles all ID-parameterized endpoints
4. **Environment variable injection** (`PFARM_MOCK_SERVER_URL`) — XCUITests set `app.launchEnvironment["PFARM_MOCK_SERVER_URL"]` to point at mock server
5. **Configurable responses** — tests can `resetRoutes()` and register scenario-specific routes

## Impact on Other Agents
- **Ripley (UI):** Can now build XCUITests that run against deterministic mock data. Use `MockAPIServer` in test setUp, pass `baseURL` via launch environment.
- **Ash (Testing):** Unit tests still use `MockURLProtocol` — no change. `MockAPIServer` is additive for integration/UI tests.
- **Dallas (Architecture):** `PFarmApp.init()` now checks `PFARM_MOCK_SERVER_URL` env var before `APIClient.savedBaseURL()`.

## Files Changed
- `PrintFarmerTests/Helpers/MockAPIServer.swift` — new (server + `MockResponses` enum)
- `PrintFarmerTests/Helpers/TestFixtures.swift` — added Spoolman fixtures
- `PrintFarmer/PFarmApp.swift` — added `PFARM_MOCK_SERVER_URL` env var check
- `PrintFarmer.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` — registered MockAPIServer.swift

---

### Decision: iPad Layout Architecture (Ripley)
**Date:** 2026-03-07
**Status:** Implemented

## Context
The app needed iPad-optimized layouts. All views were iPhone-only (single column, TabView navigation).

## Decision
Used `@Environment(\.horizontalSizeClass)` throughout to provide adaptive layouts:

1. **ContentView** switches between TabView (compact) and NavigationSplitView with sidebar (regular).
2. **Dashboard, PrinterList** use multi-column grids on iPad.
3. **PrinterDetail** uses a two-column layout (info left, camera/job right) on iPad.
4. **LoginView** caps form width at 500pt on iPad.

## Rationale
- `horizontalSizeClass` is the standard SwiftUI mechanism for device-adaptive layouts (iOS 17+).
- NavigationSplitView gives iPad users the expected sidebar pattern without breaking iPhone.
- `List(selection:)` binding is unavailable on iOS, so sidebar uses explicit Button-based rows with manual highlight.

## Impact
- All existing iPhone layouts are unchanged (guarded by `sizeClass == .regular` checks).
- `AppRouter` gained a `sidebarVisibility` property for sidebar column management.
- No new dependencies or services introduced.

### Decision: 5 New Service Layers (Lambert)
**Date:** 2026-03-08
**Status:** Implemented

## Context
Built service layers for Maintenance, AutoPrint, JobAnalytics, Predictive, and Dispatch features.

## Decisions

1. **PredictionRequest uses optional fields** — Existing PredictiveViewModel passes `material: String?` and `estimatedDurationSeconds: Int?`. Model adapted to match rather than break the ViewModel.

2. **JobFailurePrediction has dual probability fields** — Both `failureProbability` (used by ViewModel) and `predictedFailureLikelihood` (from API spec) are present as optionals. Backend can return either.

3. **Date query parameters use ISO 8601 plain format** — `APIClient.iso8601Plain.string(from:)` for URL query string dates, consistent with backend expectations.

4. **FleetPrinterStatistics uses computed Identifiable** — `var id: UUID { printerId }` with explicit CodingKeys since JSON has no `id` field.

5. **Request models are Encodable only** — Request DTOs (AcknowledgeAlertRequest, ResolveAlertRequest, etc.) conform to `Encodable, Sendable` but not `Decodable`, since they're never decoded from responses.

## Impact
- **Ripley:** Can build UI against 5 new protocols (MaintenanceServiceProtocol, AutoPrintServiceProtocol, JobAnalyticsServiceProtocol, PredictiveServiceProtocol, DispatchServiceProtocol)
- **Ash:** Needs mock implementations for all 5 new service protocols for testing
- **Dallas:** ServiceContainer now has 5 new `let` properties; any DI routing should account for them

---

### Decision: New Features UI Architecture (Ripley)
**Date:** 2026-03-08
**Status:** Implemented

## Context
Built ViewModels and Views for 7 new features: Maintenance, AutoPrint, Job Analytics, Predictive Insights, Dispatch Dashboard, Job History/Timeline, and Uptime/Reliability.

## Decisions

1. **Maintenance tab added** — `AppTab.maintenance` with `wrench.adjustable` icon, inserted after Alerts in both TabView and NavigationSplitView sidebar. Tab order: Dashboard → Printers → Jobs → Inventory → Alerts → Maintenance → Settings.

2. **6 new AppDestination cases** — `maintenanceAnalytics`, `uptimeReliability`, `predictiveInsights(printerId:)`, `jobAnalytics`, `jobHistory`, `jobTimeline`, `dispatchDashboard`. All handled in the shared `destinationView(for:)` helper.

3. **AutoPrintSection is a standalone component** — Embedded directly in PrinterDetailView (both iPhone and iPad layouts) rather than being part of PrinterDetailViewModel. Has its own `AutoPrintViewModel` and loads its own data via `.task`.

4. **Job Analytics and History accessible from Jobs tab toolbar** — NavigationLink toolbar buttons on JobListView navigate to JobAnalyticsView and JobHistoryView. Timeline accessible from within JobHistoryView.

5. **Dispatch Dashboard accessible from Dashboard** — NavigationLink card at bottom of DashboardView content area.

## Impact
- **Lambert:** ServiceContainer needs 5 new service properties: `maintenanceService`, `autoPrintService`, `jobAnalyticsService`, `predictiveService`, `dispatchService`. All ViewModels use `configure()` pattern with these service protocols.
- **Ash:** 7 new ViewModels need test coverage with mock services.
- **Dallas:** AppRouter has new `maintenance` tab case and `maintenancePath` NavigationPath. AppDestination has 6 new cases.

---

### Decision: NFC Printer Tag Write Delegate Architecture (Ripley)
**Date:** 2026-03-08
**Status:** Implemented

## Context
The existing NFCWriteDelegate takes raw `Data` bytes and wraps them in an OpenSpool media-type NDEF record. Printer tags need a URI record (`printfarmer://printer/{UUID}`) plus a text record with the printer name.

## Decision
Created a separate `NFCMessageWriteDelegate` that accepts a full `NFCNDEFMessage` rather than refactoring the existing delegate. The `writePrinterTag` method on `NFCService` is concrete (not added to `SpoolScannerProtocol`) since printer tag writing is NFC-specific and doesn't apply to QR scanner implementations.

## Rationale
- Keeps the existing spool writing path untouched and stable
- `NFCMessageWriteDelegate` is more flexible — can write any NDEF message composition
- Accessing via `nfcScanner as? NFCService` cast is acceptable since printer tag writing is inherently NFC-only
- iOS handles URI record recognition automatically — no need to modify the read delegate for printer tags

## Alternatives Considered
- Refactoring NFCWriteDelegate to accept either Data or NFCNDEFMessage — rejected, adds complexity to working code
- Adding `writePrinterTag` to SpoolScannerProtocol — rejected, QR scanners can't write NFC tags

---

### Decision: NFC/Deep Link Navigation Race Condition Fix (Ripley)
**Date:** 2026-03-08
**Status:** Implemented

## Context
When a user had Printer A open and tapped an NFC notification for Printer B, the app stayed on Printer A. Two issues:
1. `AppRouter.navigate(to:)` reset NavigationPath and appended synchronously — SwiftUI batched this as a single update and did an in-place view update instead of pop-then-push.
2. `PushNotificationManager` posted `.pushNotificationTapped` but no view observed it, so server push notification deep links were silently dropped.

## Decisions

1. **Async delay between NavigationPath reset and append** — `navigate(to:)` now resets `printersPath` synchronously, then appends the new destination after a 50ms `Task.sleep` in a `@MainActor` Task. This ensures SwiftUI processes the pop before the push.

2. **Added `.onReceive` for `.pushNotificationTapped`** — PFarmApp.swift now observes this notification, extracts the `"link"` URL from userInfo, parses via `DeepLinkHandler`, and calls `router.navigate(to:)`. Guarded with `#if canImport(UIKit)`.

## Impact
- **Lambert:** No changes needed — PushNotificationManager already posts the notification correctly.
- **Ash:** AppRouter.navigate(to:) is now async internally — any tests calling it should account for the 50ms delay before asserting NavigationPath contents.
- **Dallas:** No architectural changes — same deep link flow, just properly separated across render cycles.

## Files Changed
- `PrintFarmer/Navigation/AppRouter.swift` — navigate(to:) uses async delay
- `PrintFarmer/PFarmApp.swift` — added .onReceive for .pushNotificationTapped

---

### Feature Scope: Spool NFC Tag Writing for Inventory (Dallas)
**Date:** 2026-03-08  
**Requested by:** Jeff Papiez  
**Status:** Scoped (Ready for dev)  
**Estimated Effort:** ~10.5 hours across team

## Executive Summary

Jeff wants to add NFC tag **writing** capability for filament spools in inventory. Users should be able to:
1. See which spools in inventory have NFC tags (visual indicator)
2. Filter spools to show only those without NFC tags
3. Write NFC tags for spool data so spools can be linked to printers via NFC scan

This builds on existing **NFC read + printer tag write** infrastructure (NFCService.swift already handles both). The feature plugs into the **Inventory tab** (added Phase 1) and **SpoolInventoryView**.

## Current State & Gaps

**Existing:**
- ✅ NFCService.swift — reads NFC tags, writes printer tags (`writePrinterTag()`)
- ✅ NFCTagParser.swift — converts spool ↔ OpenSpool JSON
- ✅ SpoolInventoryView/ViewModel — displays all spools, supports filters
- ✅ SpoolPickerView + AddSpoolView with NFC scan buttons
- ✅ NFCWriteDelegate — infrastructure for NDEF writes

**Missing:**
- ❌ Backend `hasNfcTag` field on SpoolmanSpool
- ❌ UI indicator badge (green ✓ / gray −)
- ❌ "No NFC Tag" filter chip
- ❌ Write button + action flow in inventory

## Work Breakdown (8 Items, ~10.5h)

| WI | Title | Owner | Effort | Depends |
|----|-------|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Backend: Add `hasNfcTag` field | Jeff | 1h | — |
| 2 | iOS Model: Add `hasNfcTag` | Lambert | 15m | WI-1 |
| 3 | iOS View: NFC Indicator Badge | Ripley | 1.5h | WI-2 |
| 4 | iOS View: "No NFC Tag" Filter | Ripley | 1h | WI-2 |
| 5 | iOS ViewModel: Write Action | Lambert | 1.5h | WI-2 |
| 6 | iOS View: Write Button & Flow | Ripley | 2h | WI-5 |
| 7 | Integration: Wire Services | Lambert+Ripley | 30m | WI-6 |
| 8 | Tests: Full Coverage | Ash | 2.5h | All |

**Critical Path:** WI-1 → WI-2 → (WI-3,4 ∥ WI-5) → WI-6 → WI-7 → WI-8

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **`hasNfcTag` field:** Add as `Bool?` to SpoolmanSpool (optional for backward compat)
2. **Backend tracking:** Recommend DB column `Spool.HasNfcTag` (simpler than querying NfcScanEvents)
3. **No new URL scheme:** Spool tags use existing OpenSpool JSON (unlike printer tags which use `printfarmer://printer/{UUID}`)
4. **Post-write refresh:** Reload full spool list to update `hasNfcTag` from backend
5. **Write button placement:** Context menu (3-dot) to reduce list clutter

## NFC Payload Design (Existing)

**Format:** OpenSpool JSON  
```json
{
  "material": "PLA",
  "color_hex": "#0000FF",
  "brand": "Prusament",
  "weight_g": 250.0,
  "spoolman_id": 42
}
```

## API Contract (After WI-1)

```json
GET /api/spoolman/spools
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": 42,
      "name": "Blue PLA",
      "material": "PLA",
      "colorHex": "#0000FF",
      "vendor": "Prusament",
      "hasNfcTag": false,
      ...
    }
  ],
  "totalCount": 5
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Backend `hasNfcTag` missing | Jeff confirms WI-1 before iOS dev starts |
| NFC write failure on tag already written | Show error + retry button |
| Stale cache after write | Reload full spool list (WI-5) |
| Backend never sees write (phone-only) | Acceptable — user can scan to verify; printer reader will detect on auto-load |

## Questions for Jeff (Pending Confirmation)

1. **`hasNfcTag` logic:** DB column vs NfcScanEvents query count?
2. **Spool tag URL scheme:** Keep JSON or add `printfarmer://spool/{id}` URI?
3. **Write button placement:** Context menu (rec.) vs inline vs detail sheet?

## Timeline

| Phase | Work Items | Owner | Duration |
|-------|-----------|-------|----------|
| Prep | WI-1 | Jeff | 1 day |
| Backend Ready | WI-2, WI-5, WI-7 | Lambert | 2h |
| UI Dev | WI-3, WI-4, WI-6 | Ripley | 4.5h |
| Testing | WI-8 | Ash | 2.5h |
| QA/Polish | — | Dallas | 1h |
| **TOTAL** | — | — | **~2 days, 10.5h** |

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Spool list shows `hasNfcTag` badge for each spool
- ✅ "No NFC Tag" filter works (shows only `hasNfcTag == false`)
- ✅ Write button launches NFC session
- ✅ After successful write, `hasNfcTag` updates in UI
- ✅ Error handling for write failures (user-friendly messages, retry option)
- ✅ All tests pass (unit + snapshot)
- ✅ No regression in existing filament/spool features

## Cross-Team Impact

- **Lambert:** WI-2 (model), WI-5 (viewmodel), WI-7 (services)
- **Ripley:** WI-3/4 (badge + filter), WI-6 (write button + flow)
- **Ash:** WI-8 full coverage (unit + snapshot tests)
- **Dallas:** Orchestration, architecture review, test validation

## Spool NFC Tag Dual-Record NDEF Format (Ripley, 2026-03-08)

**Status:** Implemented

### Context
Spool NFC tags need to work both for in-app deep linking and for universal NFC readers (e.g., OpenSpool-compatible printers).

### Decision
Spool NFC tags use the same dual-record NDEF pattern as printer tags:
1. **URI record:** `printfarmer://spool/{spoolmanId}` — triggers deep link navigation to spool in inventory
2. **Text record:** OpenSpool JSON (`material`, `color_hex`, `brand`, `weight_g`, `spoolman_id`) — readable by any NFC reader

Both records are written via `NFCMessageWriteDelegate` (full NDEF message writer), not `NFCWriteDelegate` (raw bytes).

### Key Implementation Details
- DeepLinkHandler now supports `printfarmer://spool/{id}` URLs
- AppRouter navigates to inventory tab and highlights spool via `pendingSpoolHighlightId`
- `writeSpoolTag()` reuses the same delegate as `writePrinterTag()` — no new delegate classes
- Legacy `writeTag(spool:)` preserved for backward compat but should be deprecated in future

### Team Notes
- Backend `hasNfcTag: Bool?` field supported by SpoolmanSpoolDto (Jeff's WI-1)
- Test fixtures need `hasNfcTag: nil` parameter in all SpoolmanSpool initializers going forward
- Feature restricted to iPhone devices only (Core NFC not available on iPad)

### Decision: Swift 6 Concurrency Fixes with @preconcurrency (Ripley)
**Date:** 2026-03-08  
**Status:** Applied

## Context
Swift 6 strict concurrency mode treats Apple framework types like `UNNotificationSettings` as non-Sendable. These types cross actor boundaries (e.g., nonisolated methods returning to @MainActor), causing compiler errors that break TestFlight archive builds.

## Decision
Use `@preconcurrency import` for Apple frameworks with non-Sendable types. This is Apple's recommended migration path for Swift 6. Do NOT use `nonisolated(unsafe)` on local variables — that modifier is for stored properties only.

## Applies To
- UserNotifications
- CoreLocation
- CoreNFC
- UIKit types crossing actor boundaries

**Key File:** `PrintFarmer/Services/PushNotificationManager.swift`

### Decision: Observable ViewModel Sheet Dismissal (Ripley)
**Date:** 2025-07  
**Status:** Applied

## Context
SpoolPickerView sheet failed to dismiss reliably after selection. The environment `dismiss()` action didn't propagate `showSpoolPicker = false` through `@State`/`@Observable` bindings when async state mutations ran concurrently on the same observable.

## Decision
For `@Observable` ViewModels controlling sheet presentation via boolean properties, explicitly reset the property in the action method (e.g., `showSpoolPicker = false`) rather than relying solely on `dismiss()` from the presented view.

## Applies To
All sheet-presenting flows using `@Observable` ViewModels with `@State` ownership.

---

### Decision: Fall Back to StatusDetail for Temperature Display (Ripley)
**Date:** 2026-03-08  
**Status:** Applied

## Context
PrusaLink printers showed "--" for hotend and bed temperatures in the iOS app, despite the web UI displaying them correctly. The backend's `PrusaLinkClient.CreatePrinterDtoAsync()` omits temperature fields from the `PrinterDto` response (used by `GET /api/printers/{id}`), but the `/status` endpoint returns them in `PrinterStatusDto`.

## Decision
`PrinterDetailView.temperatureSection()` uses nil-coalescing to fall back from `printer.hotendTemp` (etc.) to `viewModel.statusDetail?.hotendTemp`. This is backend-agnostic and works for all printer types without conditional logic per backend.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Fix the backend** — Add temps to `PrusaLinkClient.CreatePrinterDtoAsync()`. Correct long-term fix, but requires backend deploy. Filed as known gap.
2. **Use only statusDetail** — Would work but loses the benefit of printer data that already has temps (Moonraker/Bambu).

## Applies To
`PrinterDetailView.swift` — `temperatureSection()` method.

## Team Notes
- The backend `PrusaLinkClient.CreatePrinterDtoAsync()` should also be fixed to include temp fields (backend team item).
- The `PrinterCardView` (list view) is not affected because the list endpoint uses `CompletePrinterDto` which includes temps from SignalR cache.

### Decision: APIClient Empty Response Handling for Optional Types (Ripley)
**Date:** 2026-03-08  
**Status:** Implemented

## Context
The PrintFarmer API returns empty response bodies (HTTP 204 No Content or 200 with empty body) when certain resources don't exist. For example, `/api/printers/{id}/printjob` returns an empty body when no print job is active.

Previously, `APIClient.execute<T: Decodable>()` always attempted to JSON-decode the response body, which failed with "dataCorrupted" errors on empty data, even when the method signature indicated an Optional return type (e.g., `PrintJobStatusInfo?`).

## Decision
Modified `APIClient.execute<T: Decodable>()` to handle empty response bodies intelligently:

1. **Before attempting decode**, check if `data.isEmpty`
2. **If empty and T is Optional**: Return `nil` (tested via `Optional<Any>.none as? T`)
3. **If empty and T is non-Optional**: Throw `NetworkError.decodingFailed` with descriptive message
4. **If non-empty**: Proceed with normal JSON decode

## Rationale
- **Type-safe handling**: Uses Swift's type system to distinguish Optional vs non-Optional at runtime
- **Contract enforcement**: Empty bodies for non-Optional types still error (catches API bugs)
- **Better error messages**: Non-Optional empty responses get a clear error ("Empty response body for non-optional type X")
- **Minimal change**: Single check before decode, doesn't affect existing decode paths

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Add `getOptional<T>()` method**: Rejected — duplicates logic, requires callsite changes
2. **Return nil for all empty responses**: Rejected — hides API contract violations for non-Optional types
3. **Check HTTP status code (204)**: Rejected — some 200 responses also have empty bodies

## Impact
- **Affected endpoints**: Currently only `PrinterService.getCurrentJob()`, but pattern now works for any future Optional-returning endpoints
- **Backward compatible**: No changes to method signatures or callsites
- **Build status**: Clean build, no regressions

## Follow-up
- Consider documenting this pattern in API client usage guidelines
- Monitor for other endpoints that might benefit from Optional returns

### Decision: Predictive Insights Graceful Empty State (Ripley)
**Date:** 2026-03-09  
**Status:** Implemented

## Context
The Predictive Insights feature showed "Failed to decode response: The data couldn't be read because it's missing" when the API returned empty/null body (no predictions available yet). This is the same class of bug as the print job empty response fix.

## Decision
1. **All predictive model fields use `decodeIfPresent` with defaults** — the API may omit fields or return partial data. Models should never crash on missing keys.
2. **`predictJobFailure` returns `JobFailurePrediction?`** — empty body returns nil instead of throwing decode error.
3. **`getActiveAlerts`/`getMaintenanceForecast` coalesce empty body to `[]`** — array endpoints return empty arrays on empty/null body.
4. **View shows "No predictions available" empty state** — instead of an error screen, users see a friendly message explaining predictions will appear once enough print history exists.
5. **Errors are logged, not displayed** — decode/network failures go to `os.Logger`, not to the user-facing error state.

## Impact
- **Lambert:** No service contract changes needed — protocol already updated.
- **Ash:** `MockPredictiveService.predictJobFailure` now returns Optional; tests expecting force-unwrap need updating.
- **Dallas:** No architecture changes.

# Decision: Local State Override for Filament Button After SetActiveSpool

**Author:** Ripley  
**Date:** 2025-07-18  
**Status:** Implemented

## Context
After `setActiveSpool` succeeds, the printer detail endpoint (`GET /api/printers/{id}`) returns a simpler `PrinterDto` that does not include `spoolInfo`. This caused the "Set Filament" button to remain visible even though a spool was successfully assigned.

## Decision
Use a **local state override pattern** in `PrinterDetailViewModel`:
- `lastSetSpoolInfo: PrinterSpoolInfo?` is populated from the `SpoolmanSpool` data immediately after a successful `setActiveSpool` call.
- `effectiveSpoolInfo` computed property returns server-provided `printer.spoolInfo` when available, falling back to the local override.
- The view's filament section reads `viewModel.effectiveSpoolInfo` instead of `printer.spoolInfo` directly.

This is the same nil-coalescing fallback pattern used for PrusaLink temperature display.

## Impact
- **Ripley:** View uses `viewModel.effectiveSpoolInfo`; no direct `printer.spoolInfo` access in filament section.
- **Lambert:** Added memberwise `init` to `PrinterSpoolInfo` (non-breaking, additive). Ideally the backend's printer detail endpoint should also return `spoolInfo` long-term.
- **Ash:** `PrinterDetailViewModel` has new testable computed property `effectiveSpoolInfo` and `lastSetSpoolInfo` behavior to cover.

### 2026-03-09T00:27Z: Beta release v0.1.0-beta.2

**By:** Dallas (Coordinator)

**What:** Released v0.1.0-beta.2 with fixes for APIClient empty response handling, PrusaLink temperature display, Predictive Insights decode error, and Set Filament button persistence. Merged 11 commits from development → main, tagged v0.1.0-beta.2, pushed to both remotes (origin + release), cancelled stuck v0.1.0-beta.1 TestFlight build (hung for 1.5+ hours), and initiated new v0.1.0-beta.2 TestFlight build.

**Why:** User requested beta release after completing bug fix cycle. Previous build had stalled and needed to be cancelled to unblock deployment pipeline.
### Decision: User Directive — Material-First Spool Picker UX (2026-03-09T00:42)
**Date:** 2026-03-09  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Category:** Feature Alignment

## Context
Web UI spool picker updated to require user to choose material type first before loading filament. This narrows the choice list significantly before presenting all spools of that type. PrintFarmer backend added `/api/spoolman/materials/available` endpoint specifically for this pattern.

## Decision
Aligned iOS app with web UI by implementing a two-phase spool picker flow:

1. **Phase 1: Material Selection**
   - Display list of available material types from `/api/spoolman/materials/available`
   - User selects material (e.g., "PLA", "PETG", "ABS")

2. **Phase 2: Spool Selection**
   - Load spools of selected material via `listSpools(material: X)`
   - Display spool list with status filters and search (existing flow)
   - "Back" button returns to material selection

3. **Exception: QR/NFC Scanning**
   - Bypasses material selection phase entirely
   - Scan → lookup spool → auto-set material → auto-filter → auto-select

## Rationale
- **Performance**: Load ~20 spools per material instead of all 200
- **UX Consistency**: Matches web UI pattern users already know
- **Backend-aligned**: Uses specialized endpoint designed for this flow
- **Scanning fast-path**: QR/NFC bypass maintains quick workflow for tagged spools

## Implementation
- **SpoolPickerViewModel**: Added `SpoolPickerPhase` enum, phase tracking, `loadMaterials()`, `selectMaterial()`, `backToMaterialSelection()`
- **SpoolPickerView**: Split into material selection and spool selection sub-views; dynamic navigation titles and toolbar buttons
- **SpoolServiceProtocol/SpoolService**: Added `listAvailableMaterials() -> [String]` calling `/api/spoolman/materials/available`
- **MockSpoolService**: Added stub for `listAvailableMaterials()`

## Impact
- **Ripley:** Implemented spool picker redesign (4 files modified)
- **Lambert:** New service method added; no contract-breaking changes
- **Ash:** Material selection flow and back-navigation paths need test coverage

### Decision: GitHub Actions iOS Code Signing Keychain Setup (Lambert)
**Date:** 2026-03-09  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Category:** CI/CD Infrastructure

## Context
TestFlight Beta Build workflow (`.github/workflows/testflight-beta.yml`) consistently hanging at "Build for App Store" step during `xcodebuild archive`. Issue occurred on both v0.1.0-beta.1 and v0.1.0-beta.2 builds, with the step running for 1.5+ hours with no output before being cancelled.

## Root Cause
GitHub Actions macOS runners require explicit keychain management for iOS code signing. `fastlane match` imports certificates into a keychain, but `xcodebuild` on CI cannot access the keychain without explicit configuration. Without proper setup, xcodebuild prompts for keychain access (which hangs on headless CI).

## Decision
Implemented standard GitHub Actions pattern for iOS code signing with temporary keychain management:

1. **Setup Keychain** (before match step)
   - Create temporary keychain at `$RUNNER_TEMP/app-signing.keychain-db`
   - Set 6-hour timeout, disable lock-on-sleep
   - Unlock keychain and set as default
   - Configure `set-key-partition-list` for codesign access without prompts

2. **Configure fastlane match**
   - Pass `--keychain_name` and `--keychain_password` flags
   - Certificates import directly to temporary keychain

3. **Configure xcodebuild**
   - Add `OTHER_CODE_SIGN_FLAGS="--keychain $KEYCHAIN_PATH"`
   - Explicitly tell codesign where to find signing identity

4. **Timeout Protection**
   - `timeout-minutes: 30` on build step
   - Prevents infinite hangs if issue recurs

5. **Cleanup Keychain** (always runs)
   - `if: always()` ensures cleanup even on failure
   - Prevents keychain accumulation on runner

## Rationale
- **Industry standard**: Widely used across iOS CI/CD workflows on GitHub Actions
- **Security**: Temporary keychain isolated per job, cleaned up automatically
- **Reliability**: Explicit keychain reference eliminates ambiguity for xcodebuild
- **No custom tooling**: Uses built-in macOS `security` command
- **Reuses secrets**: `MATCH_PASSWORD` serves double duty as keychain password

## Impact
- **Positive**: ✅ Fixes 1.5+ hour hang; build should complete in ~10–15 minutes
- **Positive**: ✅ No changes to secrets, certificates, or provisioning profiles needed
- **Positive**: ✅ Standard pattern makes workflow easier to maintain
- **Neutral**: Adds 5 workflow steps (~50 lines YAML); keychain setup adds ~5–10 seconds to workflow runtime
- **Negative**: None identified (this is a standard, proven pattern)

## Testing & Validation
- ✅ YAML syntax validated with `python3 -c "import yaml"`
- ✅ All existing workflow steps preserved
- ✅ ExportOptions.plist verified (no changes needed)
- ⏳ Next: Test on actual GitHub Actions runner with next beta tag push

### Decision: Touch-Compliant Button Sizing System (Parker)

**Date:** 2026-03-09  
**Author:** Parker (UI/UX Designer)  
**Status:** Implemented  

#### Context
The PrintFarmer iOS app had full-width action buttons that were too short (~34-36pt), violating Apple Human Interface Guidelines (44pt minimum touch target) and causing usability issues for users with larger fingers.

#### Decision
Created a reusable `.fullWidthActionButton()` view modifier with two prominence levels:
- **Standard:** 44pt minimum height (Apple HIG compliance)
- **Prominent:** 50pt minimum height (for critical primary actions)

#### Implementation
- **File:** `PrintFarmer/Views/Components/ActionButtonStyle.swift`
- **Usage:** `.fullWidthActionButton(prominence: .prominent)` or `.fullWidthActionButton()` (defaults to .standard)
- **Applied to:** 8 view files containing full-width action buttons

#### Design Guidelines
1. **Primary Actions** (50pt) — Actions requiring extra emphasis:
   - Start Print, Resume Print
   - Emergency Stop
   - Sign In
   - Write NFC Tag (when primary action)

2. **Secondary Actions** (44pt) — Standard action buttons:
   - Pause, Cancel, Stop
   - Next Job, Skip
   - Acknowledge, Dismiss
   - Scan NFC Tag

3. **Font Sizing:**
   - Avoid `.caption` font on buttons — use `.subheadline` minimum
   - Maintain `.semibold` weight for primary actions

#### Benefits
- ✅ Apple HIG compliance (44pt minimum touch targets)
- ✅ Improved accessibility for all users
- ✅ Consistent button sizing across the app
- ✅ Easy to apply to new buttons via view modifier
- ✅ Prominent treatment for critical actions

#### Migration Notes
- Replace `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity)` with `.fullWidthActionButton()`
- Use `.prominent` for primary/critical actions
- Remove any explicit height constraints that conflict (e.g., `height: 22`)
- Upgrade `.caption` fonts to `.subheadline` on action buttons

#### Files Modified
- LoginView.swift (Sign In button)
- JobDetailView.swift (action buttons)
- PrinterDetailView.swift (action buttons)
- NFCScanButton.swift (scan button)
- NFCWriteView.swift (write button)
- AutoPrintSection.swift (action buttons)
- MaintenanceAlertRow.swift (action buttons)

#### Related Decisions
- **Impact on Ripley:** All existing button usages should migrate to `.fullWidthActionButton()` for consistency
- **Impact on other agents:** New features should use this modifier for all full-width action buttons

### Decision: Public Repository Readiness Audit (Dallas)

**Author:** Dallas  
**Date:** 2026-03-09  
**Status:** Accepted + Implemented

#### Context
Jeff requested a full security/compliance audit before making the PFarm-Ios GitHub repository public.

#### Decision
Repository is **cleared for public release** after addressing 2 required items:

##### 🔴 MUST FIX (2 items) — All completed
1. **Add LICENSE file** ✅ — MIT License with OlyForge3D copyright
2. **Add README.md** ✅ — Professional project overview with tech stack, architecture, getting started

##### 🟡 SHOULD FIX (2 items) — All completed
1. **AppConfig.swift:12** ✅ — Changed hardcoded `http://10.0.0.20:5000` → `http://localhost:5000` (env override still works)
2. **Harden .gitignore** ✅ — Added `.env`, `*.p8`, `*.p12`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `secrets/` patterns

##### 🟢 PASSED (all other areas)
- Zero secrets/credentials in code or git history
- CI/CD secrets all use `${{ secrets.X }}`
- No PII in source code
- No private repo dependencies
- Clean TODO/FIXME/HACK audit
- Test fixtures use safe example data

#### Consequences
- Repository is ready for public release
- Environment variable override (`PRINTFARMER_API_URL`) handles real deployments
- Secret/cert patterns in .gitignore provide ongoing guardrails
- Existing security practices (fastlane match, Keychain, GitHub Secrets) are production-grade

### Decision: Replace FASTLANE_USER/PASSWORD with App Store Connect API Keys (Lambert)

**Date:** 2026-03-09  
**Agent:** Lambert (Networking/DevOps)  
**Status:** Implemented

#### Problem Statement

The TestFlight Beta Build workflow (`.github/workflows/testflight-beta.yml`) was failing with:
```
Invalid username and password combination
```

This occurs because Apple no longer accepts iTunes Connect credentials (FASTLANE_USER/FASTLANE_PASSWORD) for CI-based uploads. The rejection is intentional—Apple now requires API Key authentication for improved security.

#### Root Cause

- **Apple's policy shift:** API Keys provide role-based access control and better audit trails
- **CI environment detection:** GitHub Actions runners are detected as non-standard environments; Apple's fraud detection blocks credential-based login
- **Credential-based auth designed for local:** FASTLANE_USER/PASSWORD were originally designed for local developer machines

#### Solution Implemented

##### 1. Generate App Store Connect API Key (one-time setup)

1. Log in to [App Store Connect → Users and Access → Integrations → Keys](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/integrations/api/)
2. Click **+** to create a new API Key
3. Assign role: **Developer** (minimum) or **Admin** (if available)
4. Download the `.p8` file and save securely
5. Copy `Key ID` and `Issuer ID` from the key details page

##### 2. Add GitHub Secrets (3 required)

In repository settings → Secrets and variables → Actions, add:

| Secret Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID` | Key ID from App Store Connect API page |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_ISSUER_ID` | Issuer ID (company/team ID) |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_CONTENT` | Base64-encoded content of the `.p8` file |

To base64-encode the `.p8` file:
```bash
base64 -i AuthKey_<KEY_ID>.p8 | pbcopy  # macOS
cat AuthKey_<KEY_ID>.p8 | base64 -w 0   # Linux
```

##### 3. Workflow Changes

**"Upload to TestFlight" step:**
- Removed: `FASTLANE_USER`, `FASTLANE_PASSWORD` env vars
- Added: Create temporary JSON file with API key data
- Decode base64 `.p8` content and inject into JSON template:
  ```json
  {
    "key_id": "KEY_ID",
    "issuer_id": "ISSUER_ID",
    "key": "-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----",
    "in_house": false
  }
  ```
- Pass to `fastlane pilot upload --api_key_path <json_file>`
- Cleanup temp file after upload

**"Setup code signing with fastlane match" step:**
- Removed: `FASTLANE_USER`, `FASTLANE_PASSWORD` (not needed for git-based match)
- Kept: `MATCH_PASSWORD`, `MATCH_GIT_URL`, `MATCH_GIT_BASIC_AUTHORIZATION`

#### Why This Approach?

| Aspect | Why API Keys |
|---|---|
| **Security** | API keys are scoped (role-based), revocable, and provide audit trails |
| **Reliability** | No account lockouts, no 2FA challenges in CI |
| **Compliance** | Meets Apple's policy for CI/CD authentication |
| **Standardization** | Fastlane (and xcodebuild) both support `--api_key_path` natively |
| **Maintenance** | Single secret rotation instead of managing app password + 2FA |

#### Files Modified

- `.github/workflows/testflight-beta.yml` (3 changes):
  1. Updated "Setup code signing with fastlane match" (removed FASTLANE_USER/PASSWORD)
  2. Updated "Upload to TestFlight" (API key JSON creation + cleanup)
  3. Updated "Cleanup keychain" (added API key JSON cleanup)

#### Testing & Validation

- ✅ YAML syntax validated
- ✅ All existing steps preserved (no regression)
- ✅ Workflow structure unchanged (only step content modified)

#### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| **API Key JSON (chosen)** | Standard, native fastlane support, clean | Requires base64 encoding | ✅ Chosen |
| `xcrun altool --upload-app` | Alternative Apple tool | Requires .p8 in ~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys/ | Rejected (extra filesystem setup) |
| App-specific password | Simpler than full account creds | Still relies on password auth (less secure) | Rejected (still violates Apple's policy) |
| JWT token (manual) | Maximum control | Complex implementation, not standard | Rejected (overcomplicated) |

#### Dependencies & Blockers

- ✅ No dependencies on other workflow changes
- ⚠️ **Requires:** Someone with App Store Connect admin access to generate API key
- ⚠️ **Requires:** GitHub repo admin to add the 3 secrets

#### Rollout

1. **Generate API key** in App Store Connect
2. **Add 3 secrets** to GitHub repo settings
3. **Merge workflow changes**
4. **Test:** Trigger a beta tag push to verify upload succeeds
5. **Cleanup:** Verify old FASTLANE_USER/PASSWORD secrets are no longer used elsewhere

### Decision: APIError now captures CommandResult.message (Lambert)

**Author:** Lambert (Networking)  
**Date:** 2025-07-24

#### Context
Backend printer command endpoints (filament-load/unload, active-spool, etc.) return `CommandResult` bodies on HTTP 400, using a `message` field. The iOS `APIError` model only had `title`/`detail` (matching ASP.NET ProblemDetails), silently losing the actual error reason.

#### Decision
Added `message: String?` to `APIError`. The error description fallback chain is now: `detail → message → title → "Client error (code)"`.

#### Impact
- All 400-level errors from printer command endpoints now surface the backend's actual error message to the user.
- No breaking changes — `message` is optional, existing ProblemDetails-shaped errors still work via `detail`/`title`.
- Ripley: error messages in the UI will now be more descriptive for spool/filament operations (e.g., "Spool 42 is already loaded on printer X" instead of "Client error (400)").

### Decision: Side-by-Side Button Layout Pattern

**Author:** Ripley (iOS Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-07-23  
**Status:** Implemented

#### Context
Full-width action buttons stacked vertically consumed excessive screen space when multiple actions were available simultaneously (e.g., Pause + Abort while printing).

#### Decision
Group contextually related, simultaneously-visible action buttons side-by-side using HStack. Solo actions remain full-width.

#### Rules
1. **Side-by-side buttons:** Use `HStack(spacing: 10)` with `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, minHeight: 44)` on each button label — do NOT use `.fullWidthActionButton()` inside HStacks
2. **Solo buttons:** Continue using `.fullWidthActionButton()` for full-width layout
3. **Primary actions** (Start Print, Emergency Stop): Always full-width + `.prominent` sizing
4. **Destructive buttons** (Abort, Emergency Stop): Keep red tint (`.pfError`) regardless of layout
5. **Touch targets:** Minimum 44pt height always applies (Apple HIG)
6. **Conditional pairing:** Only group buttons that appear simultaneously — use combined conditionals (`canX && canY`) with else-branch fallback for solo display

#### Files Affected
- `PrintFarmer/Views/Jobs/JobDetailView.swift` — Pause+Abort, Resume+Abort paired
- `PrintFarmer/Views/Printers/PrinterDetailView.swift` — Already implemented this pattern

---

### Decision: NFCScanButton Frame Strategy for HStack Compatibility

**Author:** Ripley (iOS Developer)  
**Date:** 2026-07-23  
**Status:** Implemented

#### Context
NFCScanButton used `.fullWidthActionButton()` modifier for its non-compact variant. When placed inside an HStack for side-by-side layout (e.g., "Set" + "Scan Tag" in PrinterDetailView's no-spool section), the modifier forced full-width rendering, breaking the even 50/50 split.

#### Decision
Changed NFCScanButton's non-compact variant from `.fullWidthActionButton()` to `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, minHeight: 44)`. This makes the button expand to fill available space (full-width when standalone, half-width when in HStack with another `.infinity` sibling) while maintaining the 44pt minimum touch target.

#### Rationale
- `.fullWidthActionButton()` is ideal for solo full-width buttons but conflicts with HStack even-splitting
- `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, minHeight: 44)` achieves the same result in standalone context and adapts correctly in HStack
- Consistent with the pattern established in JobDetailView's side-by-side buttons

#### Impact
- Any view embedding NFCScanButton in an HStack now gets correct even splitting
- Standalone NFCScanButton usage is visually unchanged
- Touch target remains ≥44pt

### Decision: Decouple CI Keychain Password from Match Secret (Dallas)

**Author:** Dallas (iOS Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-03-09  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Commit:** `fix: decouple CI keychain password from match secret in TestFlight workflow`

#### Context
The TestFlight CI workflow (`.github/workflows/testflight-beta.yml`) used `secrets.MATCH_PASSWORD` for two unrelated purposes:
1. As the ephemeral CI keychain password (create/unlock/partition-list)
2. As the fastlane match passphrase to decrypt certificates from the match git repo

When `MATCH_PASSWORD` was deleted from GitHub Secrets, the workflow broke at the keychain setup step — before it even reached the match decryption step.

#### Decision
Decouple the CI keychain password from the match secret:
- **CI keychain:** Use a hardcoded temp password (`"ci-keychain-temp-password"`) since the keychain is ephemeral — created at the start of the run and destroyed in the cleanup step. No security risk.
- **Match decryption:** Continue using `secrets.MATCH_PASSWORD` exclusively for `fastlane match --keychain_password` (the encryption passphrase for the certificates repo).

#### Rationale
- The CI keychain is a throwaway artifact — it exists only for the duration of the build and is deleted in the `Cleanup keychain` step (`security delete-keychain`).
- Using a secret for throwaway infrastructure adds unnecessary coupling and failure modes.
- This eliminates one dependency on `secrets.MATCH_PASSWORD`, making the workflow more resilient.

#### Required Secrets (documented in workflow header)

| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `MATCH_PASSWORD` | Passphrase for fastlane match certificate decryption |
| `MATCH_GIT_URL` | URL of the private certificates repo |
| `MATCH_GIT_BASIC_AUTHORIZATION` | Base64-encoded `username:token` for cert repo access |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID` | App Store Connect API key ID |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_ISSUER_ID` | App Store Connect API issuer ID |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_CONTENT` | .p8 private key content (raw or base64) |

### Decision: AutoPrint → AutoDispatch Terminology Rename (Lambert)

**Author:** Lambert (Networking / API Integration)  
**Date:** 2025-03-11  
**Status:** Implemented

#### Context
The backend frontend (React) renamed the concept from "AutoPrint" to "AutoDispatch" to better reflect its role as a dispatch queue automation system. The iOS client needed to align with this terminology for consistency across platforms.

#### Decision
Rename all client-side types, files, and references from "AutoPrint" to "AutoDispatch" while maintaining full backward compatibility with the existing API.

#### Implementation Strategy

1. **File Renames:** Use `git mv` to rename all files, preserving git history
2. **Type Renames:** Update all Swift types to use "AutoDispatch" terminology
3. **Property Name Decoupling:** Use `CodingKeys` to map Swift property names to API JSON keys
4. **API Endpoint Preservation:** Keep all API URLs as `/api/autoprint/...` (unchanged backend)

#### Key Technical Decisions

##### Property Naming Convention
- **Swift property:** `autoDispatchEnabled` (user-facing terminology)
- **JSON key:** `autoPrintEnabled` (backend contract)
- **Rationale:** Decouples client naming from backend API, prevents need for backend migration

Example:
```swift
struct AutoDispatchStatus: Codable, Sendable {
    let autoDispatchEnabled: Bool
    
    private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case autoDispatchEnabled = "autoPrintEnabled"
    }
}
```

##### Files vs Types Renamed
- ✅ **Renamed:** All client files, types, protocols, classes
- ❌ **Unchanged:** API endpoint URLs, JSON field names

#### Impact
- **Scope:** Networking layer, models, services, view models, views, tests
- **Breaking Changes:** None (API compatibility maintained)
- **Team Alignment:** iOS now matches React frontend terminology
- **Future Proofing:** If backend later renames endpoints, only URL strings change (types already updated)

#### Files Changed
- Models: `AutoDispatchModels.swift`, `Models.swift`
- Services: `AutoDispatchService.swift`, `AutoDispatchServiceProtocol.swift`, `ServiceContainer.swift`
- ViewModels: `AutoDispatchViewModel.swift`, `PrinterDetailViewModel.swift`
- Views: `AutoDispatchSection.swift`, `PrinterDetailView.swift`
- Tests: `MockAutoDispatchService.swift`, `AutoDispatchViewModelTests.swift`
- Project: `project.pbxproj`

#### Considerations for Future
- If backend API endpoints ever change from `/api/autoprint/` to `/api/autodispatch/`, only the service layer URL strings need updating
- If backend renames JSON fields, update the `CodingKeys` mapping
- This pattern (CodingKeys for API compatibility) can be applied to other terminology migrations

### Decision: AutoDispatch PendingReady State UI Design (Ripley)

**Author:** Ripley (iOS Developer)  
**Date:** 2026-03-11  
**Status:** Implemented

#### Context
The auto-dispatch system has three states (`None`, `PendingReady`, `Ready`) but the UI was only showing a generic state string. When a print completes with auto-dispatch enabled, the printer enters `PendingReady` state — waiting for operator confirmation that the bed is clear before dispatching the next job.

#### Decision
Implemented state-specific UI with three distinct presentations:

##### 1. PendingReady State (Bed Clear Required)
- **Visual:** Warning banner with exclamation triangle icon + `.pfWarning` color
- **Message:** "🔔 Bed Clear Required" with subtitle
- **Primary action:** "Confirm Bed Clear" button (prominent, warning-colored)
- **Secondary action:** "Skip" button (bordered)
- **Additional info:** Queue count if available

##### 2. Ready State (Dispatching)
- **Visual:** Success indicator with checkmark icon + `.pfSuccess` color
- **Message:** "✅ Bed cleared — dispatching next job..."
- **Additional info:** Filament check result + next job name
- **No actions:** System is handling dispatch

##### 3. None State (Idle)
- **Visual:** Simple state indicator
- **Message:** Current state string ("Unknown", etc.)
- **Actions:** Standard "Next Job" + "Skip" buttons

#### Design Rationale

##### State Handling
- Used **if/else conditional** instead of switch for Optional<AutoDispatchState>
  - Cleaner than exhaustive switch with separate nil and .none cases
  - Swift treats `.none` as ambiguous between enum case and Optional.none

##### Button Contextualization
- Same "mark ready" action, different labels based on state:
  - PendingReady: "Confirm Bed Clear" (urgent, warning tint)
  - Other states: "Next Job" (standard, accent tint)
- Reduces cognitive load: one primary action per state

##### Visual Hierarchy
- Warning banner stands out but isn't alarming (not error red)
- Banner padding (12pt) and corner radius (10pt) match existing card style
- Full banner width with internal HStack layout

#### Technical Implementation

**AutoDispatchViewModel:**
```swift
var parsedState: AutoDispatchState? {
    guard let stateStr = status?.state else { return nil }
    return AutoDispatchState(rawValue: stateStr)
}
```

**AutoDispatchSection:**
- Three computed views: `pendingReadyView`, `readyView`, `idleView`
- One `actionButtons` view with context-aware button text/tint
- State icon/color helpers use enum cases instead of string lowercasing

#### Alternatives Considered

1. **Switch statement for state:** Rejected due to Optional enum exhaustiveness issues
2. **Separate buttons for each state:** Rejected to avoid UI layout shifts
3. **Error-colored banner:** Rejected as PendingReady is normal operation, not failure

#### Impact
- **UX:** Operators have clear guidance on when bed-clear is needed
- **Performance:** No additional API calls; uses existing status data
- **Maintenance:** State-specific views are isolated and testable
- **Consistency:** Follows existing color token usage (`.pfWarning`, `.pfSuccess`, `.pfAccent`)

### Decision: Demo Mode Architecture (Dallas)
**Date:** 2026-03-19  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Scope:** Protocol-based mock service injection for App Review

## Context
Apple rejected TestFlight build — reviewers had no way to exercise features without live Printfarmer backend credentials. Demo mode provides self-contained feature showcase with realistic mock data and no network required.

## Architecture Summary
Protocol-based mock service injection via `ServiceContainer.demo()` factory. App code unchanged; DI layer swaps mock implementations at runtime.

### Phases Completed

**Phase 0: Protocol Gaps** — Created `AuthServiceProtocol` and `LocationServiceProtocol`

**Phase 1: ServiceContainer Retyping** — Changed property types from concrete to protocol (`any XServiceProtocol`)

**Phase 2-3: Demo Infrastructure & Services** — Built 13 demo service implementations with pre-populated canned data

**Phase 4: SignalR Simulation** — `DemoSignalRService` runs timer-driven simulation (printer progress +0.3–0.7% every 5s, job queue updates every 30s)

**Phase 5: Login UI** — "Try Demo Mode" button in `LoginView`, `AuthViewModel.loginAsDemo()` method

**Phase 6: Banner & Settings Exit** — Persistent amber banner in `RootView`, "Exit Demo Mode" in settings

## Mock Data Specification
- **6 printers**: Prusa MK4 ×2, Bambu X1C, Bambu P1S, Voron 2.4, Ender 3 V3 (diverse states)
- **12 jobs**: 3 printing, 1 paused, 2 queued, 3 completed, 2 failed, 1 cancelled
- **8 spools**: PLA/PETG/ABS/TPU/ASA from 5 vendors
- **3 locations**: Workshop (3 printers), Office (2), Garage (1)
- **10 notifications**: 4 unread (mix of job/queue/system events)
- **Stats**: 847 jobs, 91.2% success rate, 2,340 print hours
- **3 maintenance alerts**: 1 critical (nozzle overdue), 2 warnings

## Design Rationale
1. **Protocol injection** — Leverages existing architecture, zero ViewModel changes, testable
2. **Singleton DemoMode** — UserDefaults-backed `isActive` bool, persisted across sessions
3. **Banner placement** — VStack (not overlay) prevents interaction issues with top content
4. **SignalR simulation** — Timer-driven events give Apple reviewers "live" farm experience
5. **No backend dependency** — All mock data pre-populated; no network calls

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Demo data staleness** — Keep DemoData in sync during feature development; add to PR checklist
- **Apple rejection** — Include ALL features (SignalR sim, NFC stubs, full screen coverage)
- **Demo as default** — `DemoMode.isActive` defaults to false; cleared on real login

## Build Status
✅ All phases build successfully — zero errors, zero new warnings

### Decision: CarPlay Scene Crash Prevention (Ripley)
**Date:** 2026-01-XX  
**Status:** Implemented  

## Problem
App crashed on launch when connected to CarPlay — no CarPlay support implemented, app didn't know how to handle CarPlay scene sessions.

## Solution
Added scene configuration handling to `AppDelegate`:
- `application(_:configurationForConnecting:options:)` returns appropriate config based on scene role
- For `.windowApplication` → standard window scene
- For other roles (CarPlay, etc.) → minimal valid config with correct role

## Implementation
```swift
func application(
    _ application: UIApplication,
    configurationForConnecting connectingSceneSession: UISceneSession,
    options: UIScene.ConnectionOptions
) -> UISceneConfiguration {
    if connectingSceneSession.role == .windowApplication {
        let config = UISceneConfiguration(name: "Default Configuration", sessionRole: .windowApplication)
        config.delegateClass = nil
        return config
    } else {
        return UISceneConfiguration(name: nil, sessionRole: connectingSceneSession.role)
    }
}
```

## Consequences
### Positive
- ✅ No crash on CarPlay connection
- ✅ No new dependencies or entitlements
- ✅ Gracefully handles future unsupported scene types

### Negative
- ⚠️ App won't appear on CarPlay (expected — we don't support it)
- ⚠️ Requires code changes if full CarPlay support added later

## Files Modified
- `PrintFarmer/App/AppDelegate.swift` — Scene configuration methods

### Decision: Runtime ServiceContainer Hot-Swap for Demo Mode

**Author:** Ripley (iOS Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-03-18  
**Status:** Implemented

## Context
Demo mode was broken — tapping "Try Demo Mode" set auth state but the ServiceContainer still held real service implementations, causing infinite loading spinners across all screens.

## Decision
Made ServiceContainer properties mutable (`var` instead of `let`) and added `switchToDemo()` / `switchToReal(baseURL:)` methods. The same container instance stays in SwiftUI's environment; only its service implementations swap at runtime.

## Rationale
- Avoids needing to replace `@State services` in PFarmApp (SwiftUI doesn't re-propagate replaced @State objects well)
- @Observable on ServiceContainer means property mutations automatically trigger view updates
- Keeps the single-container architecture — no second container, no environment rebinding

## Trade-offs
- Service properties are now `var` instead of `let`, reducing compile-time immutability guarantees
- Acceptable because ServiceContainer is the single source of truth and mutations only happen via the two switch methods

## Files Changed
- `PrintFarmer/Services/ServiceContainer.swift`
- `PrintFarmer/ViewModels/AuthViewModel.swift`
- `PrintFarmer/Views/Auth/LoginView.swift`
- `PrintFarmer/Views/Settings/SettingsView.swift`

### Decision: AuthViewModel holds ServiceContainer, not AuthServiceProtocol

**Date:** 2026-03-18  
**Author:** Ripley (iOS Dev)  
**Status:** Implemented

## Context

The demo-mode hot-swap feature (prior fix) made `ServiceContainer` swap its service implementations at runtime via `switchToDemo()` / `switchToReal()`. However, `AuthViewModel` captured `any AuthServiceProtocol` at init time and never re-read from the container. After exiting demo mode and logging in with real credentials, the VM still called `DemoAuthService.login()`, returning demo data.

## Decision

`AuthViewModel` now holds a reference to `ServiceContainer` and accesses `services.authService` dynamically at every call site. The `loginAsDemo()` and `exitDemoMode()` methods no longer accept a `services` parameter since the VM already owns the container reference.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** Auth operations always use the current service implementation, regardless of how many times the container swaps between demo and real.
- **Positive:** Simpler API surface — callers don't need to pass ServiceContainer into demo mode methods.
- **Positive:** LoginView and SettingsView no longer need `@Environment(ServiceContainer.self)` just for those calls.
- **Trade-off:** AuthViewModel is now coupled to ServiceContainer rather than a protocol. This is acceptable because the VM already managed demo/real switching logic.

## Pattern Established

When a ViewModel operates in a hot-swappable service environment, it must hold the *container* and read services dynamically — never capture a service protocol reference at init.

### Decision: Enable NSAllowsArbitraryLoads for HTTP Server Connections

**Author:** Lambert  
**Date:** 2025-07-22  
**Status:** Implemented

## Context
Users connecting to local Printfarmer servers over HTTP (non-SSL) were getting connection failures. The Info.plist only had `NSAllowsLocalNetworking = true`, which only covers `.local` domains and bare IP addresses — not HTTP connections to arbitrary hostnames.

## Decision
Added `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads = true` to the `NSAppTransportSecurity` dictionary in Info.plist, alongside the existing `NSAllowsLocalNetworking`. This allows HTTP connections to any host, which is needed for local/dev server setups without SSL.

## Trade-offs
- **Pro:** Users can now connect to any Printfarmer server over HTTP, which is common for local/dev environments.
- **Con:** Disables ATS protections globally. Acceptable for a local-network printer farm management tool.
- **Future:** If App Store submission requires it, we can switch to per-domain exceptions (`NSExceptionDomains`) instead.

## Files Changed
- `PrintFarmer/Info.plist` — added `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads`
- `PrintFarmer/Services/APIClient.swift` — explicit handling for ATS error code in `performRequest`
